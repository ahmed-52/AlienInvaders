Alien Invaders Game - Additional Features

1. Boss Alien:
   This enemy appears after all regular aliens are defeated and has additional health, requiring multiple 
   hits to defeat. It marches across the screen just like the regular aliens, and has a distinct shooting pattern, 
   firing 3 times every 4 seconds.

2. Player Score:
   A scoring system has been added to enhance the competitive aspect of the game. 
   Players earn points for each alien defeated, with a significant bonus for defeating the Boss Alien. 
   The score is displayed on the screen, allowing players to track their progress and aim for high scores.

3. Dynamic Alien Movement:
   The aliens now move faster as each one is destroyed. This dynamic difficulty 
   increases the challenge as the player progresses through the wave, keeping the 
   gameplay engaging and responsive to the player's actions.

4. Lives Representation:
   The player's remaining lives are now visually represented by heart icons at the top of the screen. 
   This intuitive display allows players to quickly see how many lives they have left, adding to 
   the game's user-friendliness and visual appeal.

5. Enhanced Game Aesthetics:
   The game has been visually enriched with a background image, providing a more immersive experience. 
   The background adds depth and context to the gameplay, complementing the arcade aesthetic.
